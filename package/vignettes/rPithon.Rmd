rPithon
=======

Introduction
------------

`rPithon` is a package which allows you to execute Python code from within R, passing R
variables to Python, and reading Python results back into R. The functions are based on
those from [rPython](http://rpython.r-forge.r-project.org/), but the way it works is
fundamentally different: in this package, an actual Python process is started and
communication with it occurs over a so-called pipe. To exchange data, the `rPithon`
package also makes use of `RJSONIO` to convert data structures to and from the JSON
format.

This approach of communicating with a separate Python process instead of linking Python
directly into the current R session, has a few advantages:

 - if the python code causes a crash or exits the process, this does not terminate the
   current R session, only that particular Python process is affected.
 - several Python processes can be used, so that different packages don't need to use
   the same namespace. By letting a package use its own process, you won't need to
   worry about some other package using the same names.
 - different Python interpreters (for example, of versions 2 and 3) can be used.
 - works on GNU/Linux, OS X and MS-Windows.

Since the Python execution speed is exactly the same, the only disadvantage I can think 
of is that communication with the Python process could be a bit slower.

As was already mentioned, the R functions are nearly identical to their `rPython`
counterparts, so many thanks to Carlos J. Gil Bellosta for releasing said package.
