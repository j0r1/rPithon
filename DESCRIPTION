Title: Package allowing R to use Python, by communicating using a 'pipe'.
Author: Jori Liesenborgs, Carlos J. Gil Bellosta
Maintainer: Jori Liesenborgs <jori.liesenborgs@uhasselt.be>
Description: This package allows you to use Python from within R. It is based on rPython
    (by Carlos J. Gil Bellosta), but instead of linking to the Python libraries,
    a Python program is started and is communicated with using a 'pipe'. This
    approach also allows multiple Python instances to be started, so that
    different R programs can use different Python instances if desired.
